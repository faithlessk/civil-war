    <h1>What was the American Civil War?</h1>
    <p>The American Civil War was a civil war fought from April 12, 1861 to May 9, 1865. In the United States between the Union states and the Conderate
      states, he northen Union states wanted to end slavery, while the southern Confederate states wanted to keep
      slavery. This argument turned into a war. Abraham Lincoln was soon elected as president and ended slavery. But
      what happened in the process?</p>
    <h1>What caused the Civil War?</h1>
    <p>Before the Civil War took place was the Missouri Compromise. THe Southern states wanted to allow slaves to vote,
      while the Nothern states had already gotten rid of slavery. This was a clear disadvantage to the Northern states,
      so a compromise to made in Missouri: each slave would count as three fifths of a vote. This a compromise would
      only make the states happy for a short time, though. Soon after, the Northern states turned into the Union, and
      the Southern states turned into the Confederates.</p>
