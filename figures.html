      <p class="figuretext">Ulysses S. Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant (April 27, 1822 – July 23,
        1885) was an American military officer and politician who served as the 18th president of the United States from
        1869 to 1877. As president, Grant was an effective civil rights executive who created the Justice Department and
        worked with the Radical Republicans to protect African Americans during Reconstruction. As Commanding General,
        he
        led the Union Army to victory in the American Civil War in 1865 and thereafter briefly served as Secretary of
        War.

      <p class="figuretext">Andrew Johnson (December 29, 1808 – July 31, 1875) was the 17th president of the United
        States, serving from 1865 to 1869. He assumed the presidency as he was vice president at the time of the
        assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Johnson was a Democrat who ran with Lincoln on the National Union ticket,
        coming
        to office as the Civil War concluded. He favored quick restoration of the seceded states to the Union without
        protection for the former slaves. This led to conflict with the Republican-dominated Congress, culminating in
        his
        impeachment by the House of Representatives in 1868. He was acquitted in the Senate by one vote.

      <p class="figuretext">Robert Edward Lee (January 19, 1807 – October 12, 1870) was a Confederate general best known
        for his service to the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, during which he was
        appointed
        the overall commander of the Confederate States Army. He led the Army of Northern Virginia, the Confederacy's
        most
        powerful army, from 1862 until its surrender in 1865. During the war, Lee earned a solid reputation as a skilled
        tactician, for which he was revered by his officers and men as well as respected and feared by his Union Army
        adversaries.

      <p class="figuretext">Thomas Jonathan "Stonewall" Jackson (January 21, 1824 – May 10, 1863) served as a
        Confederate
        general (1861–1863) during the American Civil War, and became one of the best-known Confederate commanders after
        General Robert E. Lee.[2] Jackson played a prominent role in nearly all military engagements in the Eastern
        Theater of the war until his death, and had a key part in winning many significant battles.
